      <p> How about we use the table again to show off the quick answers!</p>


      <table>
        <tr>
            <th> What is something I wish I could do but I don't have the skills for yet?</th>
            <th> I would love to make games and apps but I dont know how to start or work on that yet.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> What am I struggling with?</th>
            <th> The amount of info that all seems <i>mostly</i> useful.</th>

            <th> How do I solve problems? </th>

        <tr>
            <th> What method do I use to get unstuck?</th>
            <th> I take a second to look away but when I come back I usually ask the internet. Basically every question I'll ever ask has already been answered by someone!</th>

      <h2> #1 </h2>
      <p> Since we started working on the website I've had an idea to make a small flash game and host it on here for people to play!</p>

      <h2> #2 </h2>
      <p> i know there is a lot of information on the web, but not all of it is super useful. With that being said filtering through them all can teach me a lot, but it's also very time consuming and doesn't garentee I learn anything.</p>

      <h2> #3 </h2>
      <p> I first do a lot of reviewing / trial and error changing. If this isn't very fuitful then I will search then internet and read as much as I can to figure out what I am missing.</p>

      <h2> #4 </h2>
      <p> When I get stuck I usually take a moment to step away from what I'm looking at for just a second and try to come back with a fresh set of eyes. When I come back to it I like to listen to youtube videos on the issue while I either work through it or are reading about the issue. If all else fails or it's taking too long I will ask someone else and see if other people know what I'm missing! (#help channel)</p>
