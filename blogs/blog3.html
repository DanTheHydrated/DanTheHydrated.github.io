    <h2> What are the different roles HTML, CSS, and javaScripts play?</h2> 
    <p> This may come off a little disjointed and abstract but this is how I've been thinking about it!
        <table>
            <tr>They work together like a house</tr>
            <tr>
                <th> Html </th>
                <th> This is the frame of the foundation, frame, and location of the house.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> CSS </th>
                <th> This works as the style and decoration of the house.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> JavaSricpt </th>
                <th> This works as the functionality of the house.</th>
            </tr>
        </table>
        The html is what we build off of. It's the base of what we are going to be seening, it doesnt have much style or functionality 
        but we cant build of of nothing. 
        JavaSricpt is all the behind the seens functionality, its the electrical work that makes the lights turn on and off when we need them too.
        It's the Ac unit that always keeps us comfortable, down to the hinges on the doors, we dont see it working in the background but its always running 
        to keep the house working properly!
        Then we get to the CSS, This is the sytle of the house, this is the style of the windows and doors and where they all go! this also controloes the paint and the layout on the inside.

    <h2> Pseudocoding </h2>
    <p>
        Well honestly I love Pseudocoding but my brain hates it. While I've always known setting a path for myself is great and helps keep me on task its hard to start the pseudocoding process 
        without coding for me. Theres a disconect between the two in my brain. For example Setting up logic and thinking through what needs to happen and in what order is easy to put on paper 
        <i>BUT</i> Going from paper to action isn't alwasy easy. The code and what I write down is going through the same ideas as what I've written down on paper. 
        However what I've written down is always scattered and disorganized, this makes it easy for me to write down general pseudocode and then expanding and trouble shoot with the code itself if feels like, 
        which compleatly takes away the purpose of pseudocode itself. I know This is an area I really need to work on at the moment. :/
