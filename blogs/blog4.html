    <p> This was my last week of onboarding and I definitely feel like I fell behind in the class a little toward the end. But I'm super excited for the in person portion!</p>

    <h2> What was helpful? </h2>
    <p>
        The zoom calls first off, They were a great time to listen to what everyone has done and see how I can do better myself! 
        Another thing that really helped was slack, I know I should have used the help channel more but reading through other peoples questions always really helped me understand my own problems more!
        Also with the resourses tab it was easy to find other really helpful documentation and videos. I also found that a sandbox is amazingly helpful for me, I like trial and error a lot to figure things out and its a whole lot easier to do that in a sandbox and just move things over as they work!

    <h2> What was holding me back? </h2>
    <p>
        Well honestly myself. I can work really really hard in my own space with nobody around when I feel like I know exactly what I'm doing. But whenever actualy learning, That is a lot harder for me to force myself into doing. Not that I can't, 
        But the amount of time I wasted these past weeks has been upsetting to me. It's hard for me to force myself into a learning state of mind and keep myself there whenever I'm alone and in my own space.
        I also 100% didnt Pseudocode well enough, I did pseudocode a fair bit but it wasn't nearly as much as I should and

    <h2> How did I overcome challenges? </h2>
    <p> 
        Well I just want to say there is nothing more helpful then someone who belives in you! My girlfriend Katie has been a big help the whole time!
        I also spent a whole lot of time reading trough documentation, watching videos, and just brute force learning. Was this the best way to learn? Well no, it was probably the worst way I could. But that is how I learn when I'm by myself haha.
        Also working at my friends house while they also do homework is a great way to keep myself on task without having to scream at myself.
