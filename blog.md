<h1> My first week in the Awesome Inc. Program! </h1>

<h2> How was my first week you might be asking? </H2>

How about I cut to the chase and give you some bulletpoints?

- Was my first week what I was expecting? *mostly yes*
- What am I exited to learn more about? I really want to learn more creating my own website and long term how to build an AI!
- What can you learn here and nowhere else? I've had a tab open to the Live stream of Artemis 1 on the launch pad all week!

Lets go a little bit more in detail on those topics really quick!

<h3> How close was this week to what I was expecting? </h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly expected a lot of reading but not this much. I also am jumping back into school for the first time in a few years so its a wild adjustment for me. 
Overall I'm excited, nervous, and loving it! (side note I've never had more tabs open in my life)
