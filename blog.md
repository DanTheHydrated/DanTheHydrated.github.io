<h1> My first week in the Awesome Inc. Program! </h1>

<h2> How was my first week you might be asking? </H2>

How about I cut to the chase and give you some bulletpoints?

- Was my first week what I was expecting? *mostly yes*
- What am I exited to learn more about? I am really exited to learn more java to create a fun and interactive website for people to enjoy! 
- What can you learn here and nowhere else? I've had a tab open to the Live stream of Artemis 1 on the launch pad all week!

Lets go a little bit more in detail on those topics really quick!

<h3> How close was this week to what I was expecting? </h3>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly expected a lot of reading but not this much. I also am jumping back into school for the first time in a few years so its a wild adjustment for me. 
Overall I'm excited, nervous, and loving it! (side note I've never had more tabs open in my life)

<h3> What am I exited to learn more about? </h3>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always wanted to make my own website that tracks the current location of the ISS in real time! the all you would need to do is look at the site (perferably an app honestly) and it'll tell you where to look and what to look for!

<h3> What can you only learn here? </h3> 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well all week I've had a Live stream up that shows the Artemis 1 SLS rocket on the Launch Platform! I'll have this up until Monday the 29th! The two hour launch window opens at 8:33am! #WEAREGOING!
