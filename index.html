<h1> My first week in the Awesome Inc. Program! </h1>

<h2> How was my first week you might be asking? </H2>

How about I cut to the chase and give you some bulletpoints?

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>1. Was my first week what I was expecting?</th>
    <th><i>mostly yes</i></th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>2. What am I excited to learn more about?</th>
    <th>I am really excited to learn more java to create a fun and interactive website for people to enjoy!</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th>3. What can you learn here and nowhere else?</th>
    <th>I've had a tab open to the Live stream of Artemis 1 on the launch pad all week!</th>
   </tr>
</table>

Lets go a little bit more in detail on those topics really quick!

<h3> How close was this week to what I was expecting? </h3>

 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly expected a lot of reading but not this much. I'm also jumping back into school for the first time in a few years so its a wild adjustment for me. 
Overall I'm excited, nervous, and loving it! (side note I've never had more tabs open in my life) </p>

<h3> What am I excited to learn more about? </h3>
  
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always wanted to make my own website that tracks the current location of the ISS in real time! Then all you would need to do is look at the site (perferably an app honestly) and it'll tell you where to look and what to look for! </p>

  
    <h1> Hello World! </h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p> I just recently started in my Awesome Inc. Program and this is where I'm showing off exactly what I've learned! 
      This site is where I will show off things like photos links and other weird things I want to show off! kinda like this! </p>
